Jade is a fun app which is based on Gem, as simple app I discovered on GitHub and loved the experience of using it, so I decided to port it to Space.

Jade is really fun to use and offers 10 pages to write different notes. By default, the apps will open on page 1 and you can switch to other pages with `CTR+1` to `CTR+0` keys (look at your keyboard).

I hope you enjoy using Jade as much as I do.
